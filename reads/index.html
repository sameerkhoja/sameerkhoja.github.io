  <p>Sapiens</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Although I'm not the biggest fan of studying history I thought this was a
super interesting read. From how we formed as humans to the intersection
of economics, conquest, and religion this book masterfully weaves
seemingly disparate concepts throughout the history of us.
A bit of a long read, but would definitely recommend!</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Who Owns The Future</p>
    <ul>
      <li>I loved how this book is not just about technology and the information age.
This book discusses the value of venture capital in investing into the future,
and how we are entering an era where user interaction and design is
becoming as important as ever.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The Lean Startup</p>
    <ul>
      <li>This book definitely lives up to the hype. As I potentially may start my
own company in the future I really enjoyed reading The Lean Startup.
Must-read!</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Venture Deals</p>
    <ul>
      <li>This was a really informative read. I would definitely recommend it to
anyone interested or getting into venture capital, but it may not be
super necessary for everyone to read. Regardless, really interesting
and explained complex concepts really well.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The Nickel Boys</p>
    <ul>
      <li>This fiction novel by Colson Whitehead focused on an imaginary correctional
where black students would suffer through, called Nickel Academy. Whitehead
gives a glimpse into what was happening in the then-Jim Crow era, and made
analogies to several real academies, primarily in Florida. Would definitely
recommend this book as it provides a great window into Jim Crow-era society.</li>
  </ul>
	<p>Steve Jobs</p>
		<ul>
			<li>This book by Walter Isaacson dives into the life and mind of Steve Jobs,
from when he first met Steve Wozniak all the way until his final days.
A very personal account of his life, and I would definitely recommend
this to anyone as a source of true inspiration.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Educated: A Memoir</p>
		<ul>
			<li>This book, based on a true story of Tara Westover, is about a young woman's
search to Education and triumph over her family's poverty and lifetime
of abuse. Tara provides a transparent yet powerful window into her life,
and there is a lot to take away from the book from ambition to love. Would
100% recommend this book!</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Insanely Simple: The Obsession That Drives Apple's Success</p>
		<ul>
			<li>This book by Ken Segall is more of a guide into how to bring simplicity
into the workplace. It talks about Apple's heyday, and how he and several
other Apple executives brought simplicity through a set of mantras that
were instrumental in the success of the iPod, iPhone, and iPad. One of my
most favorite reads, really insightful for anyone interested in technology!</li>
	</ul>
