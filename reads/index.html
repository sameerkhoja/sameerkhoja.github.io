  <p>Sapiens</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Although I'm not the biggest fan of studying history I thought this was a
super interesting read. From how we formed as humans to the intersection
of economics, conquest, and religion this book masterfully weaves
seemingly disparate concepts throughout the history of us.
A bit of a long read, but would definitely recommend!</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Who Owns The Future</p>
    <ul>
      <li>I loved how this book is not just about technology and the information age.
This book discusses the value of venture capital in investing into the future,
and how we are entering an era where user interaction and design is
becoming as important as ever.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The Lean Startup</p>
    <ul>
      <li>This book definitely lives up to the hype. As I potentially may start my
own company in the future I really enjoyed reading The Lean Startup.
Must-read!</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Venture Deals</p>
    <ul>
      <li>This was a really informative read. I would definitely recommend it to
anyone interested or getting into venture capital, but it may not be
super necessary for everyone to read. Regardless, really interesting
and explained complex concepts really well.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The Nickel Boys</p>
    <ul>
      <li>This fiction novel by Colson Whitehead focused on an imaginary correctional
where black students would suffer through, called Nickel Academy. Whitehead
gives a glimpse into what was happening in the then-Jim Crow era, and made
analogies to several real academies, primarily in Florida. Would definitely
recommend this book as it provides a great window into Jim Crow-era society.</li>
  </ul>
